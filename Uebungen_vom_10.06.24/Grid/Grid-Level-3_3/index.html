                    <h4>Shattering cookware</h4>
                    <p>
                        More than 37,000 people were injured from using
                        cookware. Hot handles can burn and sometimes glass
                        cookware can shatter.

                    <h4>Microwave oven burns</h4>
                    <p>
                        More than 10,000 people were hurt using microwaves.
                        Burns were most common.

                    <h4>Knife cuts</h4>
                    <p>
                        Lacerations caused by knives of all kinds (not just the
                        kitchen type) affected more than 350,000 people in 2012,
                        according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
                        Dull knives are actually more dangerous than sharp ones,
                        because they require more pressure to use and their worn
                        edge can cause the knife to slip off food and into your
                        fingers.

                    <h4>Cooking fires</h4>
                    <p>
                        Fires involving cooking equipment account for two of
                        every five reported home fires. Unattended cooking
                        equipment accounts for one in three fires, and half are
                        ignited by fat, grease, oil, or related substances,
                        according to the National Fire Protection Association.

                    <h4>Contact Burns From Equipment</h4>
                    <p>
                        The oven is magic. No longer do we have to sear our food
                        on an open fire like our ancestors did; we have a nifty
                        box that keeps the heat contained and cooks our food to
                        perfection. But all that heat combined with metal
                        components and cookware leads to loads of burns. Quick
                        tips (which are obvious, but good to keep in mind):
                        Always use oven mitts, replace them when they’re old;
                        don’t use a wet towel as an oven mitt; don’t reach your
                        arm in to check baked goods, pull out the rack to test;

                    <h4>Death to the Pathogens</h4>
                    <p>
                        The most insidious of all dangers, perhaps, are the
                        germs lurking in your food. The Centers for Disease
                        Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that each year
                        roughly one in six Americans (or 48 million people) gets
                        sick, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die of
                        foodborne diseases. The top five culprits sending
                        Americans to the hospital are salmonella, norovirus,
                        Campylobacter spp., Toxoplasma gondii and E.coli – but
                        much can be done in terms of proper food handling,
                        cooking and storage to help prevent these pathogens from
                        causing illness.
